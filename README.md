First of all, I'm going to start by apologizing to everyone responsible
for authoring these themes.  I do not know all of your names, so until
I've managed to dig through every single file of all of them and locate
your identity; consider this my "Thanks to: <you>" section.

Now onto the README!

GTK, unless otherwise noted, refers to GTK2, and GTK+.  GTK3 is GTK3 (duh)

Note About WMFS1/MinimusWM themes: 
You will need to edit the rc files, as any lines pointing to $HOME are 
"/home/<yourname>/" and may cause errors if you just drop them into 
~/.config/{wmfs,mwm} so make sure to edit them.  They look best with the
Tewi font (https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font) but for the sake of 
consistency, the default font is set to Monospace since almost all modern
machines ship with that font pre-installed.

TODO:

- Add appropriate credits for all items.
- Add larger Elegant Brit wallpaper pack
- Find/Create Elegant Brit icons
- Create Elegant Brit themes for every WM/DE I can find
